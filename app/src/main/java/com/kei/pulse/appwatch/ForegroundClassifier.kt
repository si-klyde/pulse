 *
 * Extracted from [ForegroundAppMonitorService.isNeutralForeground] so the package-name rules are unit
 * testable (the service method also short-circuits on the stateful `uiInForeground`, which stays there).
 * This is the guard behind two leaks fixed historically: the OSD popping up / the global-default AutoTDP
 * binding over a Settings screen instead of treating it as Android UI.
