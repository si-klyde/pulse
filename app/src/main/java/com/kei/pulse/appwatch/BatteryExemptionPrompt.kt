 * Pure decision for the one-time "let PULSE ignore battery optimization" system prompt.

 * PULSE keeps a persistent foreground watcher alive (global Fan/RGB, AutoTDP, OSD). With battery
 * optimization ON, the OS throttles that service in Doze and is quicker to reclaim it under memory
 * pressure, so when the master switch is on we ask the user, once, to exempt PULSE. (Nothing can
 * survive an explicit force-stop / recents-swipe; this only addresses Doze + background reclaim.)
