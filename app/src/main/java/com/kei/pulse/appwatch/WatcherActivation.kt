/**
 * Decides whether the foreground-watcher service should run.
 *
 * The watcher drives two kinds of feature:
 *  - **foreground-dependent**, per-app profiles, AutoTDP, and the OSD overlay all read the foreground
 *    app via UsageStats, so they need the "Usage access" special permission to do anything;
 *  - **foreground-free**, the global Fan mode and joystick RGB just re-assert global hardware state
 *    every tick and never look at the foreground, so they need no permission at all.
 *
 * Gating the *whole* service on Usage Access (the old behaviour) silently killed the global Fan/RGB on a
 * fresh install, and across a reboot, even though they don't need it. Centralising the decision here
 * keeps the service's keep-alive ([ForegroundAppMonitorService]) and the boot restart
 * ([com.kei.pulse.boot.BootCompletedReceiver]) in lock-step so they can never drift apart again.
