 * release latch + notify state). Extracted because this was the last big imperative fan decision, and its
 * release path silently assumed the fan was already at the vendor default: `stopCustomFan(restoreVendor=true)`
 * only restored anything when a Custom loop had been running, so turning the global Fan card OFF after
 * managing a vendor mode left that mode stuck forever. [FanArbiterTest] pins the full truth table.
 *
 * Read-cost contract: [decide] invokes [readLiveMode] (one root `settings get`) ONLY when the decision needs
 * the live mode, never for AutoTDP-owned, Custom-loop, or latched-release ticks. The fan reconcile shares
 * the process-wide PServer lock with the AutoTDP cap re-asserts, so needless reads are a regression class.
