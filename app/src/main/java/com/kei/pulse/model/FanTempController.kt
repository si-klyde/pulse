/**
 * Closed-loop temperature-target fan controller, the genuine control-theory approach to fan management.
 *
 * Instead of a static temp→% lookup (open-loop, can't adapt to ambient / load / dust / aging), a **PI
 * controller** drives the fan duty to hold the SoC at [targetTempC]:
 *
 *   duty = minSpin + Kp·e + Ki·∫e dt,   where e = currentTemp − target   (positive e = too hot → more fan)
 *
 * - **P** reacts immediately to how far over target we are; **I** trims out steady-state error (a persistent
 *   overshoot slowly pulls the fan up until temp settles on target). This *automatically* uses the minimum
 *   fan needed: silent at the floor when cool, ramping exactly as much as required when hot.
 * - **Anti-windup** (conditional integration): the integral only accumulates when the output isn't pinned at
 *   a rail in the same direction, so after a long pin at 100% it recovers to quiet instantly, no overshoot.
 * - **Hard safety:** at/above [FanCurve.THERMAL_OVERRIDE_C] it forces 100% and dumps the integral.
 *
 * Gains default to robust, conservative values (the SoC thermal plant is slow, and the service's duty-slew
 * further smooths the output), tuned on real hardware, not by pumping heat into the device. Pure +
 * unit-tested; the service feeds it the live temp each tick and slews the fan toward the returned duty %.
