/**
 * Pure, device-free resolver for the side-control UI state after a power-tier transition.
 *
 * These are the knobs that [com.kei.pulse.ui.TunerViewModel.applyTier] historically set by
 * hand-copying a scatter of `MutableStateFlow` assignments, the exact place state-restoration bugs
 * slip past a green build: a transition that releases/clears device tuning but forgets to mirror it
 * in the "current values" UI, leaving the readout diverged from real sysfs. Centralizing the
 * contract here makes those omissions a single, unit-tested source of truth.
 *
 * Scope: the seven simple flag/value side-controls. The governor is restored via its own controller
 * path (it is not a plain flag), so it is intentionally not modeled here.
