/**
 * Decides whether PULSE should ACTIVELY drive the Custom fan (vendor manual passthrough, `fan_mode=6`) or hand
 * the fan back to the vendor's quiet Smart curve.
 *
 * Why this exists: in manual passthrough the vendor stops regulating the fan, so if PULSE's process dies (a
 * force-stop SIGKILL, an LMK kill, the boot gap) the duty is left stranded at the vendor's ~50% mode-init reset
 *, i.e. the fan runs LOUD with no one to pin it back down. That bites hardest at IDLE (home screen), which is
 * exactly where the user force-stops / reboots.
 *
 * The fix: hand the fan to vendor Smart only when the chip is **cool**, below [engageTempC] AND the closed
 * loop only wants the floor. There, vendor Smart is just as quiet as PULSE's floor, so handing off doesn't make
 * the fan louder, and a dead PULSE leaves the fan quiet + vendor-regulated. We engage Custom the instant the
 * chip warms past the threshold OR the curve/PI wants active cooling, and release back to Smart only after
 * [RELEASE_TICKS] sustained cool ticks (engage-fast / release-slow ⇒ no flapping). So PULSE's quiet control
 * under load is fully preserved, only true idle is handed off.
 *
 * Applied to the global Custom fan only, NOT during AutoTDP, where the chip is under game load and the
 * fan↔clock cascade wants the fan ready to spin up.
