 * Pure parsing for the Quick Access bar's controller-combo trigger. Reads LABELED `getevent -l` lines
 * (e.g. "<device>: EV_KEY   BTN_THUMBL   DOWN"), tracks which buttons are held by name, and decides when a
 * saved combo is pressed. Stateless, the watcher carries the held-set across reads. No device access here.
 *
 * Labeled + key-name based (not raw hex) on purpose: `getevent -l | grep EV_KEY` filters out the analog-stick
 * flood, keeps the output short enough for PServer's first-line read, and gives human-readable combos.
