/**
 * AutoTDP, holds a **user-set FPS target at the least power**, by regulating each clock domain against
 * live FPS *and* frame pacing:
 *
 *  - The panel is pinned to its **max refresh** (by the service) for latency; AutoTDP then trims clocks
 *    so the frame rate settles at [targetFps] instead of running flat-out.
 *  - **Per CPU cluster, prime/big first** (then performance, then efficiency), and the **GPU last**: the
 *    prime cluster is the biggest power hog and least often the limiter, so it gives up its slack first
 *    (often "for free", with no FPS cost), then the GPU eases the rate down toward the target.
 *  - **Above** the target (with headroom) it trims; **below** the target it raises the binding domain
 *    (GPU first); **in-band** it holds. A trim that worsens **frame pacing** (more ≥33 ms hitches) is
 *    undone and that domain frozen one notch above its edge, the smoothness rail.
 *  - **Max** target (0) means uncapped: keep the clocks open, only thermal trims.
 *  - **Steady-render gate:** trimming + power-split learning only happen once the app has been
 *    *continuously* rendering for a few steps; a static/bursty screen (no FPS) holds and resets the gate.
 *  - Periodic **re-probe** clears the frozen set; a **stall** restores clocks fast; a **thermal** read
 *    forces a trim regardless.
 *
 * It pairs with the Balanced CPU governor (forced by the service), which scales frequency to load *under*
 * the caps. Device writes go through [writeCaps]/[releaseCaps], which reuse [PerformanceCommandBuilder]
 *, the same path as the manual tiers, so the caps are written and then **locked read-only (`chmod
 * 444`)**; otherwise the vendor perf/thermal daemon silently stomps `scaling_max_freq` back to full
 * (and the GPU's `min_pwrlevel` must be widened first or the cap snaps back). Unit tests inject no-ops
 * so the decision logic can be driven with FPS/jank sequences.
 *
 * **Aggressive park** (opt-in, [aggressivePark]): on heavy emulators the vendor perf HAL floors the
 * prime cluster's min frequency during gaming, so a frequency cap can't lower it. When the frame rate
 * is comfortably above target with the prime already trimmed to its floor (i.e. the prime isn't the
 * limiter), AutoTDP **offlines the prime cores** to drop their draw to zero, and re-onlines them the
 * instant FPS dips, jank rises, or it overheats/stalls. A cooldown after a failed park stops flapping.
