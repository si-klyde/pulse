/**
 * Drives the Odin 3 fan from a [FanCurve] as a CONTINUOUS slew so the fan ramps smoothly instead of
 * audibly stepping. Two cadences:
 *  - [setTarget] (slow, ~1s telemetry tick) picks the curve's % for the live SoC temp, the goal.
 *  - [slew] (fast, ~300ms loop) eases the applied % toward that goal by [slewPerSecond] × dt and WRITES the
 *    duty every pass. That write is also the re-assert that beats the vendor fan service (it re-pins the 20%
 *    floor every ~2–4s); a tight loop with tiny increments holds the fan steady AND sounds smooth.
 *
 * Safety: at/above [FanCurve.THERMAL_OVERRIDE_C] the slew SNAPS straight to 100% (never ramps into an
 * overheat). The applied % can never write below the vendor-safe floor ([FanCurve.percentToDuty] clamps).
 * Device I/O is injected so the slew logic is unit-testable; the companion supplies the real sysfs impls.
 * The caller assigns the *effective* curve (any Cooler/Quieter bias already folded in) and decides when to
 * drive, see [FanController.customFanAvailable]; stopping (just stop calling [slew]) hands the fan back.
