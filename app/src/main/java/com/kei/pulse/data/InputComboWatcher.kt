/**
 * Drives the Quick Access bar's controller-combo trigger via a root-shell `getevent` reader (PServer).
 *
 * Two detection modes:
 *  - **STREAM (preferred)**: a persistent detached root `getevent` pipeline appends EV_KEY lines to a file;
 *    the consumer polls it with ONE short lock-held read+truncate every [STREAM_POLL_MS]. Capture is LOSSLESS
 *    (no blind gap), so a chord can never be missed and the cross-poll held-set in
 *    [InputComboParser.advanceHeld] is correct. The lock is also held far less than the windowed mode
 *    (~tens of ms per poll vs a full 1 s window), so the fan/AutoTDP re-asserts get MORE turns, not fewer.
 *  - **WINDOWED (fallback)**: the original bounded `timeout 1 getevent` windows with the [DETECT_GAP_MS]
 *    lock-free gap. Used when the producer can't start/survive (PServer absent, old firmware quirk). Its gap
 *    makes it blind ~37% of the time, that was the "combo sometimes doesn't open / opens late" bug.
 *
 * Which mode engaged is logged under `PulseCombo`, that's the on-device verification channel (PServer is
 * SELinux-hidden from the adb shell uid, so the stream's survival can only be proven by this runtime check).
