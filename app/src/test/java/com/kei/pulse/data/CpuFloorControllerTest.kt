/**
 * Pure-logic tests for [CpuFloorController]'s prime-skip + cap-clamp discipline (Bug 1). The device
 * write itself goes through RootSupport (verified on hardware), but the two decisions that make the
 * floor cap-safe, which clusters are floorable, and what each floor target is, are pure and tested here.
