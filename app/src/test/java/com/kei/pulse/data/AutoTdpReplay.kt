/**
 * Re-runs a parsed `PulseAutoTdp` capture through the **real** [AutoTuneController.step] off-device, with
 * no-op device writers (exactly as `AutoTuneControllerTest` drives it). This turns a 20-minute physical
 * tuning test into a millisecond JVM re-run: feed a real session's tick stream into the *current*
 * controller code and see the action/cap trajectory it now produces, and where it diverges from what the
 * device recorded.
 *
 * **Open-loop only.** This answers *"does my change alter which action/caps the controller produces on this
 * real session?"* (decision-logic regression). It does NOT predict the new policy's resulting fps/temp/power
 *, those would be the device's closed-loop response to different actions, which isn't in the recording.
 * Never read a replayed trajectory as an fps prediction.
 *
 * Caveats on the recorded-vs-replayed comparison: the replay is **seeded from the recorded opening caps** so it
 * starts where the recording did, leaving a **one-tick offset** (the logged caps are post-decision, so tick 0 is
 * seeded with its own result) and the **rounded** logged inputs as the residual sources of minor divergence.
 * That's why the divergence report is a human-read diagnostic, while the deterministic golden-regression test
 * asserts the replayed trajectory against a checked-in expected trajectory (replay-vs-expected, not
 * replay-vs-recorded).
